# coilgun
This is an entirely custom Coilgun setup that uses electromagnetic propulsion to launch a small ferrous rod at high velocities. The magnetic field is created by discharging 4 560 microFarad capacitors wired in parallel to a coil of enameled copper wire. 
 
It features an arduino setup that uses an infrared sensor to calculate the speed of the projectile as it exits the barrel of the gun, and outputs that value to an led display. The code used can be found in the repo. 

These were used together in an expirement to see if it was more effective to add turns in an additional layer or to increase the length of the coil.
